- Make a real README.md with all the steps of functionality (ex: make env files in backend/frontend, run seed_movies.py, build_content_recommender, etc.)/project description
    Setup:
    - Install the dependencies: "pip install -r requirements.txt" from backend + other unlisted dependencies / "npm install package.json" from frontend 
    - Make a .env file in the backend directory with your MONGO_URI and TMDB_KEY
    - Make a .env.local with a VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:5000
    - Run "python seed_movies.py" from backend
    - Run "python scripts\build_content_recommender.py" from backend (run this every time you rebuild the database with seed_movies.py)
    - To boot up the project, run 'flask run' from backend and 'npm run dev' from frontend

    Features:
    - Search
    - Three different movie sections: Popular, Top, New
    - Recommendations

-DONE- 1. Fix Top Rated (add a cutoff point for the votes ex: min 2000)
-DONE- 2. Make recommendation row start earlier and end later, in order to fit all movies without scrolling

DONE: AUTHENTICATION
--DONE-- - Add confirmation on successful register/login
--DONE-- - Add logout functionality

struggled a lot with route security because of user_recommendations, had to use
    samesite="None" if IS_PROD else "Lax",
    secure=IS_PROD,

also had to reroute server in vite.config.ts:
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/api": {
        target: "http://localhost:5000",
        changeOrigin: true,
        secure: false,
      },
    },
  },
and change hardcoded URLs so they don't bypass that if they included credentials.
    fetch("/api/my-list", {
      credentials: "include",
    })

    instead of 

    fetch(`http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/movies/${id}`) {
      credentials: "include",
    }


--DONE FOR NOW-- Improve recommendations (collaborative filtering => account => what user adds to My List)
WORKING ON: User-based recommendations
  --DONE-- Improve the user-based recommendation scripts
      - Recommend movies liked by behaviorally similar users, weighted by similarity strength, while reducing global popularity bias

--DONE-- Make Search results be right clickable/middle clickable so they can be opened in a new tab

--DONE-- Improve the Hero Section, make it scrollable with ~5 movies, dynamic/different on reload
--DONE-- Improve the "Score" rating for a movie (ex: only limit to 2 digits: 7.5, 6.2; color it differently for each range: 1-4 red (bad), 5-7 orange(okay), 8-10 good (green))
--DONE-- Add sorting/
      filtering/
      genres/
--DONE--? better pagination to the main page

--DONE-- Improve feel of responsive design on smaller screens. (genres list vertically, smaller movie cards, smaller text on details page)

--DONE-- Add option to remove movie directly from My List

--DONE-- Make the movie trailer show up when the user clicks "Play" (separate popup window vs full screen?)

TODO Add the separate routes from the navbar (New, etc.)
        --DONE-- Add TV Shows 
          - Fix Trailer API getting /api/movies/549/trailer HTTP/1.1" 200  instead of the TV Show route
          - Add TV Details page
          - Remove unwanted TV series (needs a reseed)
          - Test/implement recommendations for TV Series (mix/separate?)

TODO AI Recommendations + Chatbot(?)
