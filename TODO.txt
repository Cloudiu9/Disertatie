- Make a real README.md with all the steps of functionality (ex: make env files in backend/frontend, run seed_movies.py, build_content_recommender, etc.)/project description
    Setup:
    - Install the dependencies: "requirements.txt from backend / package.json from frontend
    - Make a .env file in the backend directory with your MONGO_URI and TMDB_KEY
    - Make a .env.local with a VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:5000
    - Run "python seed_movies.py" from backend
    - Run "python scripts\build_content_recommender.py " from backend (run this every time you rebuild the database with seed_movies.py)
    - To boot up the project, run 'flask run' from backend and 'npm run dev' from frontend

    Features:
    - Search
    - Three different movie sections: Popular, Top, New
    - Recommendations

--- 1. Fix Top Rated (add a cutoff point for the votes ex: min 2000)
2. Make recommendation row start earlier and end later, in order to fit all movies without scrolling
TODO 3. Improve recommendations (collaborative filtering => account => what user clicks on / likes)
